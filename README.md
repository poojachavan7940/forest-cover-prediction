# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction

This machine learning project aims to classify forest cover types based on various **cartographic and environmental features** using supervised learning algorithms.

## 📌 Project Objective
Predict the type of forest cover from geographic attributes like elevation, slope, and hydrology distances using machine learning models. The goal is to assist in environmental monitoring and forest management through data-driven classification.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Features Used
- Elevation  
- Slope  
- Aspect  
- Horizontal & Vertical Distance to Hydrology  
- Distance to Roadways & Fire Points  
- Hillshade at different times of day  
- Soil Type & Wilderness Area (categorical)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report

## 📁 File
- `forest_cover_prediction.ipynb` – Contains all preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and results.
